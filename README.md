### Project Title
Udacity - Programming for Data Science with Python - Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project basically allows you to understand more about the use of rented bikes in three main cities of the US (Chicago, New York City and Washington).
You be allowed to choose which city you want to have the data, also you are allowed to choose the months (from January to June or all of them) and you can choose the day of the week (Monday to Sunday or all of them).

After choosing the city, months and days the code outputs:
- Most common month used and how many travels occurred, if possible;
- Most common day of the week and how many travels occurred, if possible;
- Most common hour of start and how many travels occurred;
- Most common start station and how many travels occurred;
- Most common end Station and how many travels occurred;
- Most common trip between two stations and how many travels occurred;
- Total travel time;
- The mean travel time;
- Users stats such as: User type, gender, birth year, earliest birth, most recent birth, most common year of birth

By the end it will display the first five rows of data, and if the user chooses to it will show more data or it will restart or finish the code.
